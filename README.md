# SPEECH-RECOGNITION
SPEECH RECOGNITION using Correlation.Correlation is normally used in signal processing , where you need to compare two signals and need 
to find the similarity between them. Corelation is also used for pattern recognition like you want to find some pattern in the signal 
then you can use Correlation. Anyways,in our project we are using correlation to find similarity between our stored signals and the 
testing signal.
